Introduction. 
--------------------------------------
During this project I will create a recipes website to practice my skills with HTML.

What skills I've applied?
--------------------------------------
 Despite being a beginner, to speed up the creation of tags I use Emmet shortcuts, mainly in heading elements such as h2, or in ordered and unordered lists, with their respective list items. 
Also, apply most of the tags contained in the TOP lesson without any difficulty.
Although, I started to apply comments in the code relatively late. I have tried and will try to use them more often.
