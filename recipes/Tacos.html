        <h2>What is birria?</h2>
            <p>Birria is a traditional Mexican dish from Jalisco, made with slow-cooked beef or goat marinated in a mix of spices, herbs, and chiles. The meat is tenderized in a flavorful broth, and it's often served as a stew or in tacos.</p>

            <p>Tacos de birria are made by filling tortillas with the marinated meat, sometimes dipped in the broth and grilled. They're topped with onions, cilantro, and lime, and typically served with a side of consomm√© for dipping.</p>
